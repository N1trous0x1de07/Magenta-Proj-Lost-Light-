Sprint 1: During this whole sprint I was just trying to figure out what we actually wanted to make so I could start making a map for it. During the map creation process I had some trouble figuring out how to use the terrain drawing feature, but with a little assistance I figured it out and was able to get to work. Overall, we don't know what we're trying to aim for when making features in terms of specific methods so we're just trying to get things working.
