Completed Tasks:
-Whole team - Got a somewhat solid idea of what we're doing
-Graceson - got the GUi mostly working
-Mason - got a test map going

Roadblocks:
-In terms of coding knowledge we are lacking heavily (Implementing things is difficult)
-Figuring out the tilemap is more difficult than assumed
-Drawing maps of a forest from scratch takes more creative brainpower than we had thought

Pivots:
-Whole team - There were no major pivots during this time

Concerns:
-Whole team - figuring out what we can implement in a decent amount of time
