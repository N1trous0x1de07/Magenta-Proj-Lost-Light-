Sprint 1: This sprint, I got most of the UI done along with expirementing with various systems like lighting, shadows, and tilemaplayer scene placement. 
Sprint 2: Less progress made this sprint, with minimal work on the UI. Overall, the group also got a nice looking map done and NPCs seem to be going well.
Sprint 3: The UI is done as far as I can get it without loosing progress on other things. Lighting system is also done along with light sources like campfires. 
Sprint 4: I started to see the dawning reality that we are NOT doing everything we planned for the game. Only minor adjustments done during this, with fixing some odd bugs with merging and layers.
Final Thoughts: I belive the goals and what we had set out for the project was far too much than 5 (basically 4) high-schoolers could get done in a few months. Maybe if we had Nick helping us, we could've got more done, but likely not to the level we had set out. We shoul-
d've done something much more simple.
