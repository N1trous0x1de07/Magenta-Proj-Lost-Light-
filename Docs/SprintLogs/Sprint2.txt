Completed Tasks:
-Amardanzai - Got an NPC working and merged
-Mason - Fixed the issues with the NPC and re-merged, Got more work done on mapping
-Graceson - Cleaned up the GUI and got more things working.
-Graceson - Patched the game to fix small issues that were popping up

Roadblocks:
-Once you start playing the game the music gets incredibly loud for no reason.

Pivots:
-We had to start implementing more NPCs to meet requirements
-We removed the music from the gameplay because it was irreversibly broken
-We decided to change how the layering of the maps was going to be done, and from there they were changed

Concerns:
-Whole team - features are taking far longer than we had hoped to implement and they're often broken.
