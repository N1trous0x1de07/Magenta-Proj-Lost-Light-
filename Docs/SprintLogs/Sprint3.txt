Completed Tasks:
-Graceson - implemented the lighting system for the game and experimented with it further as well
-Mason - merged the new map remake for the introduction for further testing, continued work on the rest
-Amardanzai - Some of the dialogue was implemented
-Solomon - Began the process of drawing sprites for further feature implementation

Roadblocks:
-The dialogue was really difficult for Aamir to get into the game and required a lot of teacher assistance
-The sprites turned out to be more complex for Sol to make than he had thought
-Graceson is stressed and dedicates himself slightly less to the game, but still gets quite a bit done

Pivots:
-Whole team - started following the rubric down to the specific requirements in hopes of improving chances for points

Concerns:
-whole team - we're all thinking this project is going downhill and we're running short on time
