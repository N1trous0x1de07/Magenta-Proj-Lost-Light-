Roadblocks:
-There is no combat system or real enemies to be seen so progress is at a hard limit towards the end.

Pivots:
-Whole team - Switch to doing anything for easy points since the project is a mess.
-Mason - Switch from mapping to fixing everything wrong with the game along with mapping

Concerns:
-The whole team - We're definitely going to fail
