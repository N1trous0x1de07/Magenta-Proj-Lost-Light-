Sprint 1: This sprint we were just trying to get a basic understanding of the game that we want to create at the time and when we did I needed to create a dialouge system for NPC's
Sprint 2: I am just still coding on working with putting in 5 NPC's that can give you an idea of what to do in the game and also just have a small side quest
Sprint 3: I polished up on the NPC's and also then just started adding in some traps and changes in movement.
Sprint 4: Started to add in points for the game and just making some things to make the game look a lot nicer and just give you a more of a better feeling for the game
Final Thoughts- My final thoughts would just be that I think the entire process of making the game was enjoyable and I would just say I needed to make it an easeir process for myself and not making some things more longer. We also could have gone with a different game theme also but I stil think the one we have is not the worst outcome
