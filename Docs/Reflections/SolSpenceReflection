The first sprint little to nothing major happened. I personlly was in charge of sprites and assets for our game during thi time. I added the character,character movement and enemy sprites and animiations.I wish I found sprites faster and assets. I also did music here.
The second sprint I will be honest I was sick. It hendered our team and I take full acountability for that. I was there for one or two days and just polished some small things down like the character movement.
The third Sprit we started locking in showing that we could do this. I made more assests and drew with pixel arts the car parts. I also started coding them and polished them. I made it to where you could "pick them up" when you ran over them.
The last sprint we really did sprint. I drew the truck and reaserching how the car parts could get connected to the truck and work together. I then started trying to throw something together with the code. I got somewhere but the merge and files did not go well. By the end we had to scrap alot to all the code on it. BUT Mason saved the day over the weekend. Give that man a reward bro cooked.
Overall I learned alot about me as a coder and what I need to do to get better like just taking on a challange and learning. I think we could have gotten a better game if we did better in the first two sprints also I know I didn't talk about them but Mason,Grayson, and amari were great teammates and worked hard.
